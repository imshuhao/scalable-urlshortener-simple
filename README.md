# CSC409A1 Report
### 0/3 Diagram showing
- [0] 1 Application system
- [0] 1 Monitoring system
- [0] 1 Data flow

### 0/14 Discussion of each of the following with respect to your system.
- For each point, as appropriate, show an appropriate diagram, list performance guarantees, discuss code/architecture choices.
- Example:
	- Availability:
		- the availability guarantees your system provides
		- the architectural choices made to implement this
	- Data Partitioning:
		- diagram explaining how data is partitioned
		- outline how your code implements this, for example,
		if you hash, then which hash algorithm

### 0/4 Discussing the system's performance

- [0] 1 Graph showing performance of system under load1

- [0] 1 Analysis of system performance under load1

- [0] 1 Graph showing performance of system under load2

- [0] 1 Analysis of system performance under load2

### 0/4 Discussing the system's scalability

- [0] 1 Number of hosts vs read requests per second
- [0] 1 Number of hosts vs write requests per second
- [0] 1 Number of hosts vs data stored

### 0/2 Discussion of the tools used during testing. Listing them is not enough.
You must define each tool used, and how you used it
